# Thrum

Thrum is the largest dwarven city in Doloria and possibly the oldest settlement still populated. A fortress of stone and steel, stretching deep into the northern Muruvian range, the city protected itâ€™s dwarven inhabitants at the height of the Reign of the Dragons. Choosing not to fight along side the other races, they defended their cities, allowing none to leave and none to enter. Once the dragons fell, the dwarves reemerged to a world of animosity and hostility toward them for their selfishness and cowardice.
