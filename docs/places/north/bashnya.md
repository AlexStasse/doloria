# Bashnya

Bashnya is a town situated in the foothills north of Verum. Originally settled by barbarian raiders, it grew to prominence as a stronghold and, later on, for its religious significance as Helena Dolor’s birthplace.

Because of Bashnya’s history of barbarism in its inhabitants, mounting political tension prompted the Triumvirate to create a peace deal with Bashnya. In return for protection from threats from over the mountains, Verum provides a popular trade route running directly from the capital to Bashnya. Due to these constant threats, the city holds a strong military presence in the form of the Arm of Dolor.
