# Volkszauber Academy

Located on the outskirts of Verum, the Volkzauber Academy was created by a local wealthy scholar to house and foster persecuted mages in the years leading up to The Capital War. It served as the main headquarters of the New Dolorians during the war and was given to Civis Arcanum as part of the Arcanus Legis.

At present, Civis Arcanum continue to run the school for wizards and sorcerers looking to control or improve their abilities. The academy is divided into 4 Schools:

* School of Charm – Illusion and Enchantment
* School of Creation – Transmutation and Necromancy
* School of Power – Abjuration and Evocation
* School of Knowing – Divination and Conjuration
