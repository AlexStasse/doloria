# Confederate Guard

The Confederate Guard was formed after the Confederation of Doloria as a law enforcement organisation for the rebuilt Verum. Mages and fighters alike are allowed to join and undergo rigorous weapon training and studies to become official guards. Their area of operation has spread to most major cities around central Doloria.

Important news and orders are carried by the elite Postmaster wing of the Guard, comprised of the fastest and most adept horse riders in Doloria.
