# Wood Elves

Wood elves are a wild and ostensibliy uncivilised people, spread deep throughout the thick forests of Syndoril. Walking through the woods, one might be surprised to discover that they are inhabited at all – their homes are nestled deep within caves or arranged out of viny thickets, as much a part of the landscape as a bird’s nest or a wolf’s den. As for the elves themselves, they keep to themselves and are not fond of visitors. If a wood elf does not wish to be seen, no man or beast could find them.

Everything they need is provided by the forests, so they have little reason to visit the world beyond. Elves are spiritual by nature and have many established rituals and rites to honour their gods. For every elf that harnesses magic and speaks to forest spirits, however, there are twice as many fletchers, skinners, hunters and harvesters. Along with their ingrained link to the spiritual world, they are a pragmatic people who have carved out a comfortable living for themselves in Doloria’s farthest corners.

Other races would be forgiven for thinking that their existence is a myth, were it not for a few pioneering wood elves that have established links to the outside world in past years. A few outposts have been established on the outskirts of the forects. Elendor Vale is one such which serves as a trading post between Verum and the rest of elven civilisation.
